# 🇻🇳 Vietnamese Keyword-Based Speaker Identification System  
*A web-based AI system for wake-word detection and speaker identification for smart home access control.*

---

## Introduction

This project develops a voice-based identity authentication system using the Vietnamese wake word **“Quad Team ơi”**.  
The system integrates two AI models operating sequentially:

1. **Keyword Spotting (KwS)** – Detects whether the user has spoken the correct wake word.  
2. **Speaker Identification (SI)** – Identifies the user based on voice embeddings.

The system is designed for **Smart Home applications**, enabling password-free authentication using only the user's voice.

## System Architecture

### **Frontend**
- HTML templates integrated into Django  
- Runs the **KwS ONNX model** directly in the browser  
- Records audio and sends it to the backend via API

### **Backend**
- Django Framework  
- Receives and processes audio input  
- Executes the SI model for authentication  
- Manages users, rooms, and access permissions

---

## Detailed Pipeline

1. The user logs into an existing room or creates a new room.  
2. If unregistered, the user enters their name, records **three voice samples**, and selects an access role.  
3. Once inside the room, the user clicks **“Start Listening”**.  
4. The **KwS ONNX model** on the frontend detects the wake word **“Quad Team ơi”**.  
5. If the wake word is correct → audio is sent to the backend.  
6. The backend runs the **SI model** to compare embeddings with the user’s registered samples.  
7. If the similarity score exceeds the threshold → authentication succeeds → the user’s assigned permissions are displayed.

## AI Models

### **Keyword Spotting (KwS)**
- **Main model:** CNN + BiLSTM  
- **Deployment:**
  - Trained with Python  
  - Converted to ONNX for browser-based inference

---

### **Speaker Identification (SI)**
- **Main model:** MFA-Conformer  
- **Operation:**
  - Generates embedding from the recorded sample  
  - Computes cosine similarity with the user’s three registered samples  
  - Authentication determined by thresholding
